      <h3>❤️Basketball - instead of 1000 words❤️</h3>
      <p>
        Basketball, a sport that epitomizes agility and finesse, is played on a
        rectangular court divided into two halves. Each team, consisting of five
        players, strives to outscore their opponents by shooting a ball through
        the opponent's hoop.

        At the heart of basketball is the hoop, positioned 10 feet above the
        ground, which players aim to conquer with precision and skill. The
        strategic use of teamwork, along with individual prowess, becomes
        paramount as teams strategize offensive plays and defensive maneuvers.

        sportsmanship and competitiveness. The sport has transcended its roots
        to become a global phenomenon, captivating audiences worldwide with its
        thrilling moments and showcasing the prowess of athletes who possess not
