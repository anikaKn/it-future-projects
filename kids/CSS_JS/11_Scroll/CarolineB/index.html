      <h3>❤️Potato - what makes the world such a great place❤️</h3>
      <p>
        Potatos are rich in vitamin C, which is an antioxidant. Potatoes were a
        life-saving food source in early times because the vitamin C prevented
        scurvy.

      <h3>Nobody knows who invented the potato chip</h3>
      <p>
        While there are a handful of stories out there concerning the origin of
        the iconic snack, the reality is that nobody can really prove exactly
        where potato chips came from. The most common tale claims that potato
        chips were invented in 1853, in Saratoga, New York, completely by
        mistake.

      <h3>Potatoes were the first vegetable grown in space</h3>
      <p>
        WNASA began a collaboration with the University of Wisconsin to study
        how potatoes grow in a zero-gravity environment. The experiment didn't
        result in full-grown potatoes but it did create a foundation for today's
        results. Today's International Space Station astronauts can eat micro
        potatoes, called Quantum Tubers.
